    "### Required Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Python on your computer, you can use the [Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) to install most of the Python packages you need. Anaconda provides a simple double-click installer for your convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses several Python packages that come standard with the Anaconda Python distribution. The primary libraries that we'll be using are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy**: Provides a fast numerical array structure and helper functions.\n",
    "* **pandas**: Provides a DataFrame structure to store data in memory and work with it easily and efficiently.\n",
    "* **scikit-learn/sklearn**: The essential Machine Learning package in Python.\n",
    "* **matplotlib**: Basic plotting library in Python; most other Python plotting libraries are built on top of it.\n",
    "* **Seaborn**: Advanced statistical plotting library.\n",
    "* **waterqmark**: A Jupyter Notebook extension for printing timestamps, version numbers, and hardware information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure you have all of the packages you need, install them with `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n SYSC4415_tutorials python=3.11\n",
    "conda activate SYSC4415_tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "conda install jupyter\n",
    "conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn graphviz statsmodels\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge watermark\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda` may prompt you to update some of them if you don't have the latest versions. Allow it to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** I will not support people trying to run this notebook outside of the Anaconda Python distribution."

    "In response to this massive influx of data, the field of Data Science has come to the forefront in the past decade. Cobbled together by people from a diverse array of fields — statistics, physics, computer science, design, and many more — the field of Data Science represents our collective desire to understand and harness the abundance of data around us to build a better world.\n",

We're working with a moderately-sized team of data scientists and will be building part of the data analysis pipeline for this app.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "[[ go back to the top ]](#Table-of-contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to any data analysis project is to define the question or problem we're looking to solve, and to define a measure (or set of measures) for our success at solving that task. The data analysis checklist has us answer a handful of questions to accomplish that, so let's work through those questions.\n",

    ">Did you specify the type of data analytic question (e.g. exploration, association causality) before touching the data?\n",

    "We're trying to classify the species (i.e., class) of the flower based on four measurements that we're provided: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Did you define the metric for success before beginning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do that now. Since we're performing classification, we can use [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision) — the fraction of correctly classified flowers — to quantify how well our model is performing. Our company's Head of Data has told us that we should achieve at least 90% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific or business application?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're building part of a data analysis pipeline for a smartphone app that will be able to classify the species of flowers from pictures taken on the smartphone. In the future, this pipeline will be connected to another pipeline that automatically measures from pictures the traits we're using to perform this classification.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Did you record the experimental design?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our company's Head of Data has told us that the field researchers are hand-measuring 50 randomly-sampled flowers of each species using a standardized methodology. The field researchers take pictures of each flower they sample from pre-defined angles so the measurements and species can be confirmed by the other field researchers at a later point. At the end of each day, the data is compiled and stored on a private company GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Did you consider whether the question could be answered with the available data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we currently have is only for three types of *Iris* flowers. The model built off of this data set will only work for those *Iris* flowers, so we will need more data to create a general flower classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr />\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we've spent a fair amount of time working on the problem without writing a line of code or even looking at the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thinking about and documenting the problem we're working on is an important step to performing effective data analysis that often goes overlooked.** Don't skip it."

    "Fixing outliers can be tricky business. It's rarely clear whether the outlier was caused by measurement error, recording the data in improper units, or if the outlier is a real anomaly. For that reason, we should be judicious when working with outliers: if we decide to exclude any data, we need to make sure to document what data we excluded and provide solid reasoning for excluding that data.

In their simplest form, decision tree classifiers ask a series of Yes/No questions about the data — each time getting closer to finding out the class of each entry — until they either classify the data set perfectly or simply can't differentiate a set of entries. Think of it like a game of [Twenty Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions), except the computer is *much*, *much* better at it.\n",

    "Notice how the classifier asks Yes/No questions about the data — whether a certain feature is <= 1.75, for example — so it can differentiate the records. This is the essence of every decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice part about decision tree classifiers is that they are **scale-invariant**, i.e., the scale of the features does not affect their performance, unlike many Machine Learning models. In other words, it doesn't matter if our features range from 0 to 1 or 0 to 1,000; decision tree classifiers will work with them just the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several [parameters](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) that we can tune for decision tree classifiers, but for now let's use a basic decision tree classifier."
